# Make Backups and Restore data Base in MongoDB
hi!! this project was made with the help of Karel Alvarez, it was made in my corporate github but I decided to move it to my personal github and let it free to the public, enjoy it!

## What is this project for?
This program performs a backup of a MongoDB database on your own computer and you can restore it to any other database you want even if it is on your premises and most important of all, it is restored along with its indexing.

## How to use it?
once you have copied the whole project, you will need to install the requirements, after that you only need to run the script called "grafic_interface.py" where you must follow the instructions and place the required data to backup and/or restore a MongoDB database along with its indexing.</b>

### Important note
the project is already ready to use, however I am still improving it and configuring certain functions available later on.
